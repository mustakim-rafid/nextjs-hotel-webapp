This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## About this webapp

This is a Hotel Website developed in nextjs with typescript.

I converted the ui of the website with tailwind css and some ui libraries.

I also integrated backend with database made this a full stack application.

`In short, This is a practice project where I focused in both building ui and basic backend with database in nextjs`
